# 🧭 Prompts & References

Living documentation for AI agents and external collaborators.

## Policy

- Files in `.cursor/prompts/` and `.cursor/references/` are living docs
- Update immediately when encountering new patterns, pitfalls, or better workflows
- Fix anything that doesn’t work; add concrete examples from real implementations

## Required Actions During Work

- Follow documented steps when a guide exists
- If deviations are needed, annotate the guide and submit improvements
- Add new examples (good/bad), edge cases, and updated commands

## Examples of Useful Updates

- Replacing brittle commands with stable alternatives
- Documenting an integration quirk (e.g., a third-party script breaking partial updates)
- Adding test strategies or debug tips for common failures
