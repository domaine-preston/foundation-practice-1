        ### üèóÔ∏è Implementation Guidelines (For Reference)

        **Core Component Principles:**
        - Components should be reusable and composable
        - Follow existing patterns in `core-*` components
        - Use design tokens for spacing, colors, and typography
        - Ensure accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.2)
        - Support both light and dark color modes
        - Include responsive design considerations

        **Existing Core Components:**
        - `core-button` - Flexible button component with multiple styles
        - `core-heading` - Typography component with semantic heading levels
        - `core-text` - Rich text component with color and spacing options
        - `core-image` - Advanced image component with optimization
        - `core-video` - Video component with accessibility features
        - `core-carousel` - Swiper-based carousel with full customization
        - `core-accordion` - Collapsible content component
        - `core-group` - Layout container with flex controls
        - `core-spacer` - Spacing utility component
        - `core-divider` - Visual separator component

        **Theme Architecture:**
        - Use `@needs-script` for section-specific JavaScript
        - Leverage design tokens from `snippets/@*.liquid`
        - Follow Tailwind-first CSS approach
        - Extend core components rather than modifying them
        - Consider performance impact on Core Web Vitals

        **Common Enhancement Patterns:**
        - Add new style variants to existing components
        - Extend schema options for more customization
        - Improve responsive behavior
        - Add animation and interaction capabilities
        - Enhance accessibility features
        - Optimize for performance and loading speed
